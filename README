Brushless DC Motor Controller Project
---------------------Started by Synco

AIM: This project aims at writing improved firmware for some of the many brushless DC motor controllers available aimed at the hobbiest market.
More specifically the controllers using the Atmel ATmega8 AVR.

Some improvements include:
* specifically for making them micro-controller friendly
  - ignore the low-voltage cut-off
  - remove the features added for humans
  - allow using some protocol (I2C, UART, Pulse-width, etc)
  - get feed-back, ie, temperature, actual speed, current, errors, etc...
* Run as either speed control or torque control
* ...

Here is a list of the currently supported devices:
DYNAM ESC 30A
Mystery FM30A
(soon) HobbyKing 30A UBEC
(verify) TowerPro25a ESC
(todo) Turnigy
