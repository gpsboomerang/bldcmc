Brushless DC Motor Controller Project
---------------------Started by Synco

AIM:
====
This project aims at writing improved firmware for some of the many brushless DC motor controllers available aimed at the modellers/hobbiest market.
More specifically the controllers using the Atmel ATmega8 AVR.

Some improvements include:
* making them micro-controller friendly
  - ignore the low-voltage cut-off, power-on delays, safety interlocks...
  - remove the features added for humans; scaling throttle range, configuration mode
  - allow using some protocol (I2C, UART, Pulse-width, etc)
  - get feed-back, ie, temperature, actual speed, current, errors, etc...
* Run as either speed control or torque control
* ...

Here is a list of the currently supported devices:
Mystery FM30A - Good with UART debug 
DYNAM ESC 30A - No UART possible
(soon) HobbyKing 30A UBEC
(verify) TowerPro25a ESC
(todo) Turnigy
